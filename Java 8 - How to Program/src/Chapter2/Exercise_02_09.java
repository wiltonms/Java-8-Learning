/*  TASK 2.9 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.

a) Java operators are evaluated from left to right.
[Ans.] All binary operators except for the assignment operators are evaluated from left to right; assignment operators are evaluated right to left.

b) The following are all valid variable names: _under_bar_, m928134, t5, j7, her_sales$, his_$account_total, a, b$, c, z and z2.
[Ans.] True, because valid variable names are a series of underscores, letters and digits that do not start with a digit, and none of these conditions were violated.

c) A valid Java arithmetic expression with no parentheses is evaluated from left to right.
[Ans.] False, it will be evaluated according to their precedence and associativity.

d) The following are all invalid variable names: 3g, 87, 67h2, h22 and 2h.
[Ans.] False, h22 is a valid variable name. All of the other variable names start with digits and are therefore invalid variable names.
